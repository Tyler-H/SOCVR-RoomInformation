Periodically SOCVR will have room-wide meetings where we discuss room policies and behavior. This page outlines what we talked about.

## April 2016

### Agenda

* Can we ask for someone in the room to edit in a relevant tag on a question so that it can be single-handedly closed with the hammer?
* Should we leave a comment under posts that were closed as a result of a cv-pls in order to let the OP know how to improve their question?, if so on which close reasons?
* Does the room need to be renamed so that it doesn't focus only on "Close" activity?
* Are the activities of the room effective at meeting its goals? What can / should we do to make our votes more effective?
* Are we okay with having a lot of members being privileged Smokey users? Should only RO be privileged in SOCVR and let members be privileged in Charcoal HQ if they really want to?
* Creating editing events as well as close events (specially while burnating tags), if so, coordination of edits needs to be discussed.
* On smoke detector message when a post only needs to be edit, find a rule to avoid conflicting edits attempts, example we post chat message "I will edit" or similar.
